# Lyricolet
Lyricolet is a website that is solely dedicated to providing accurate and reliable lyrics for Musicolet users. The website makes it easy to search for lyrics by song title, artist name, or album. As a community-driven platform, users can also add and contribute lyrics to Musicolet app through GitHub page, ensuring that the lyrics are always up-to-date and precise.

This is a personal project, so expect this to finish in a long time. You can consider this as my first venture to CSS and JS and my second for HTML so don't expect any results for now
